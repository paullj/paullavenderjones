*The front page of this website*
I built this website to showcase my work and to learn web development.
The website is built with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) an application framework which is powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). All the projects and posts are written in markdown files and turned into pages.
