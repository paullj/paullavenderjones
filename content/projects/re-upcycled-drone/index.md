I gave myself the task of designing and constructing a relatively cheap drone that was made of recycled materials to see if the high cost barrier of quadcopters could be overcome. I designed a sturdy frame comprised of a polycarbonate laptop cover, a mahogany shelf, a metal bookend and a PVC pipe. I calculated the amount of force required to lift my heavy frame and hence got light, powerful but cheap motors from China along with 10 inch propellers for maximum lift.

~Hello~ this is cool i guess. And this is a [link to something](/) else.
