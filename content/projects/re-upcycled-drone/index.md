*The finished quadcopter*
I designing a drone where the frame was made entirely from recycled materials. This allowed for a ~relatively cheap~ and more ~sustainable~ alternative to a commercially available quadcopter. A rough design was drawn up so that the relevant parts could be sourced.

*Assembly and wiring diagram*
The sturdy frame comprised of a polycarbonate ~laptop cover~, a mahogany ~shelf~, a steel ~bookend~ and a PVC ~pipe~. The laptop cover made up the main base of the quadcopter, where the recycled shelf arms were attached. The controller and power distribution boards are mounted onto the base where the ECSs can connect to from each arm. The steel bookend was made into a holder for the LiPo battery and attached to the underside of the quadcopter.

*Cutting steel bookends for the battery holder*
Using recycled materials also meant that the frame was on the ~heavier side~ and so I had to use light, ~powerful but cheap motors~ which I sourced from China along with 10 inch propellers for maximum lift.
