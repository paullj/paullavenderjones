# Sapper + Tailwind Personal Website

I built this website to showcase my work and to learn web development.
The website is built with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) an application framework which is powered by [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). All the projects and posts are written in markdown files and turned into pages.

### Running the project
However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Building or exporting the project
To export your static website bundle run `yarn export`.
